#
# /etc/sysfs.conf - Configuration file for setting sysfs attributes.
#
# The sysfs mount directory is automatically prepended to the attribute paths.
# The attribute paths support glob(7) wildcard patterns.
#
# Syntax:
# attribute = value
# mode attribute = 0600 # (any valid argument for chmod)
# owner attribute = root:wheel # (any valid argument for chown)
#
# Examples:
#
# Always use the powersave CPU frequency governor
# devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = powersave
#
# Use userspace CPU frequency governor and set initial speed
# devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = userspace
# devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed = 600000
#
# Set permissions of suspend control file
# mode power/state = 0660
# owner power/state = root:power
